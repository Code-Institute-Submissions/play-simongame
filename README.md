# *PROJECT NAME: Simon Game* : *Project 2*



## Project Concept

 The project is a popular Simon game.The initiative behind the project is to simulate 
 similar project for academic purposes to enable student to show understanding and display of knowledge in 
 JavaScript, HTML, CSSS, JQuery and other concepts learnt in the module. My utmost achievement is the project has enabled me to apply my knowledge and understanding  
 of the syntax of JavaScript.

### Wireframes

The Wireframe was initially created at the design phase to understand the basic functionality of the game and what users 
will be expecetd to see as the final prodcut.

  Ideas to implement are :
  * Different levels of play mode : This will find it stimulating to users to build their memory strength .Such as 
    Normal and Easy mode.
  * Link to share game with friends on social media sites.
  

## Technologies Used
### Frameworks and libraries used in the project

[JavaScript:](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)The project is heavily based on JavaScript used to build the project.

[SemanticHTML:](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) The project uses HTML to write the code.

[CSS:](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) Used style the gameboard.

[Gitpod:](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) Workspace Editor for writing the code.

[Github:](https://github.com) It's used as repository for version control and commit update.

[Markdown:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template/master/README.md) Used to write ReadMe file.

[Jquery:](https://jquery.com/). Used to manupulate  the DOM elements.

[Balsamic:](https://balsamiq.com/) I have used this tool to design the interface of the game functionality.


## Testing
-----------------------------
Testing was carried out in two stages :
[Automated](https://daat2.github.io/jasmine-simonTest/)

[Manual](https://gitpod.io/#snapshot/adfc57bb-1451-42db-a151-98eb20d17145)




 
## Deployment
------------------------
Deployment process followed to deploy to Github Pages :

Deployment steps : Go into settings> github pages> master branch.
The project is deployed in [Github pages](https://daat2.github.io/play-simongame/)

### Steps for a developer to run the project locally.


Link sent to developer [simongame](https://daat2.github.io/play-simongame/ ).

-Click on cloan or download highlighted in green.

Go to your location in your terminal.

Do git clone and paste the link.

This will clone the project on your computer.

Enter CD change directory (Name of project).

This will enable the developer to open the project within its computer in the editor.

# *PROJECT NAME: Simon Game* : *Project 2*



## Project Concept

 The project is a popular Simon game.The initiative behind the project is to simulate 
 similar project for academic purposes to enable student to show understanding and display of knowledge in 
 JavaScript, HTML, CSSS, JQuery and other concepts learnt in the module. My utmost achievement is the project has enabled me to apply my knowledge and understanding of the syntax of JavaScript.

 ## UX 
The game user experiene has been built to help user to navigate and interact with the game board with ease.

1.	User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

   As a game player,
   I want to be presented with ON and Off buttton,
   so that I can press the ON and OFF button on the game board.  
   **Acceptance criteria**: Game player can press ON and OFF.

   1.1. As a game player, i want to be able to press the start button,So that i can interact with series of buttons on the game console.  
  **Acceptance Criteria** :Game player can interact with game console at the click of the start button.


2. User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, i see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.\
  As a game player,
  I want to be able to see input of button presses.
  So that i can interact with additional steps to play the game further.\
 **Acceptance Criteria**: Game player was able to press series of buttons with additional steps required to carry on playing the game.

### Wireframes

The Wireframe was initially created at the design phase to understand the basic functionalities of the game and what users 
will be expecetd to see as the final prodcut.

# Features
----------------------------------

## Existing Features on the game board :
 * ON/OFF Switch toggle button : This enable users to interact with the gameboard
 initiate the game.
 * Four Colored Buttons : These are interactive buttons for users to press to play the game and see the effects of each button presses.
 * Start Button : This enable game player to start the game,a sound is heard to verify start button function.
 * Strict Button :Enable game player to  play in the strict mode, a check mark is displayed in the box to verify strict mode 
 is on and no check mark means users play in normal mode.
 * Count Button : This button displays the game player levels as they press the buttons to interact with the game 
 * Help Button ? These are PDF user manual to enable game player to understand how to play the game. 

    
## Features Left to Implement
  Due to time constraint on the project have not been priviledge to implement Certain features :
  Ideas to implement are :
  * Different levels of play mode : This will enable player to find it stimulating to build their memory strength.Such as 
    Normal and Easy mode.
  * Link to share game with friends on social media sites.
  * Further improvements to be made for responsiveness using media queries.
  

## Technologies Used
### Frameworks and libraries used in the project

[JavaScript:](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)The project is heavily based on JavaScript used to build the project.

[SemanticHTML:](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) The project uses HTML to write the code.

[CSS:](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) Used style the gameboard.

[Gitpod:](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) Workspace Editor for writing the code.

[Github:](https://github.com) It's used as repository for version control and commit update.

[Markdown:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template/master/README.md) Used to write ReadMe file.

[Jquery:](https://jquery.com/). Used to manupulate  the DOM elements.

[Balsamic:](https://balsamiq.com/) I have used this tool to design the interface of the game functionality.


## Testing
-----------------------------
See attached link for detailed manual testing.\
Automated testing would have been done, but my mentor said is not needed for my code.

[Manual Testing](https://github.com/daat2/play-simongame/blob/master/assets/images/manualTest-simon.pdf)

* The project was tested on the different devices [IOS,Android, desktop and Laptop].

* The test was conducted across two browsers- Firefox and Google Chrome. 

* Operating System used for testing : Windows 8 and Windows 10.

* I carried out User Acceptance test by sending link to friends to test the basic game functioanlity and feedback received.

* The part of the requirements for the test is based on the user stories in the UX header.

* The objective of the test is for players to be able to interact with the game.
 
## Deployment
